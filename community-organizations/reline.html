    <h1 class="p-h2">Reline</h1>

    <p class="p-subheading">Reline is a video art DVD compilation series I co-created with Scott Pagano. We started with a vision in 2001 to build a lasting record of the emergence of technology-based art. The series featured artists from around the world employing custom software and modified hardware to create work focused on graphic abstraction, the broken output of dysfunctional systems, and the desire to re-vision both old and new technologies.</p>

    <img src="../images/reline2_cover.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="Reline 2 DVD cover art" style="width: 100%; margin-bottom: 2em;">

    <div style="text-align: left;">

    <h2 class="p-h3">The Vision</h2>
    <p class="p-body">Scott and I began Reline because we saw something happening that nobody was archiving. Artists everywhere were using code and hardware to create new visual forms, but the work was ephemeral. It lived on projections at clubs and galleries, on screens at festivals, and then it was gone. We wanted to create a physical object that captured this moment and gave it permanence. The DVD was the medium of the time, and we used it to build something that was part video archive and part work of art itself. Often seen lugging their projectors to and from venues ranging from dive bars to galleries, these video mavens had a pixel-itching desire to augment and enhance environments and static architecture. Reline served the dual goal of contextualizing and developing an emerging media form, establishing solid ground for video art in a world with an increasing desire to have a dialog with its screen.</p>

    <h2 class="p-h3">Reline 1 (2002)</h2>
    <p class="p-body">The first Reline DVD was released in 2002 on Form Records and neither-field. The DVD cover was designed by Keep Adding. It featured one hour of work from 10 artists, bringing together a diverse array of work showcasing artists engaged with the creation of new visual forms derived from experimental processes and techniques, often foregrounding the un-criticized role technology plays in our lives. The image assemblages were created using everything from laptop-driven generative software, busted cameras, and circuit-bent video mixers, all with a drive to heartily misuse industry standard production tools.</p>
    <p class="p-body">My own piece, <em>The Shadow of Digital Living</em>, was about my experience with technology as it evolved during my lifetime. I suffer from a condition called Repetitive Strain Injury, caused by constant and repetitive exposure to computers. Many people are beginning to break down biologically as a result of un-ergonomic, purposefully anti-body input devices. RSI forced me to cut my long hair off because I simply could not physically comb through the knots. This happened simultaneously to the dot-boom/dot-bust economic crash. I found irony in this. Using a broken DV camera, dropped during a political protest rally, and a circuit-bent video mixer, I created re-processed images of my hair that became a metaphor for the way technology both positively and negatively integrates into society.</p>

    <p class="p-body">The response exceeded anything we expected. Reline 1 screened at the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts in San Francisco, the Guggenheim Bilbao in Spain, Lincoln Center in New York City, the Austin Museum of Digital Art, the Santa Fe Art Institute, and galleries and festivals throughout the US and Europe.</p>

    <p class="p-body">The second volume came out in September 2006 on Microcinema's Blackchair label. At 64 minutes in 5.1 surround sound, it featured 19 works. Where the first volume captured a broad spectrum from lo-fi to hi-fi, Reline 2 pushed further into the high end of experimental production while maintaining a diversity of approaches. The artists investigated modern mythology, examined environments, exploded form, and played with similes between machine and body. From buildings ripping apart by unseen forces to characters on strange journeys in wild imagined spaces, these videos explored the integration of technology into every layer of our lives. Through the use of custom software, unique processing methods, and envelope-pushing applications of traditional production tools, these pieces pushed technical limits and the very bounds of style and imagination.</p>
    <p class="p-body">On Reline 2, I contributed <em>Drawdown</em>, a collaboration with Arnold Steiner with sound by Brian Jackson (Infinite Volume), completed in 2004. Drawdown refers to the process by which the dominant species in an ecosystem uses up the surrounding resources faster than they can be replaced. The piece explores the relationship between man, machine, environment and the culture of greed in the world. Looking at the body as both a polluted system and a vehicle for enlightenment, we see the human form as an evolving machine empty of meaning in and of itself. In this context, the delusions of ego and self-importance become clear. Drawdown suggests we look beyond our own selfish desire to see the vast beauty and abundance of the world around us. As we look for the basic meaning of human existence amidst a technological culture, we must question if our technologies aid human evolution or accelerate the process of extinction.</p>

    <p class="p-body"><strong>RES Magazine</strong>, Jesse Ashlock (on Reline 2): "The 18 experimental films on Reline2, the second in a series of progressive audiovisual compilations from DVD distributor Microcinema, hit the senses like a rollercoaster ride, producing vertigo, wooziness and a profound uncertainty about which way is up... Overall, Reline2 succeeds impressively at challenging seemingly hardwired perceptions about spatial relationships and the interface between the self and the outside world."</p>

    <h2 class="p-h3">Where Are They Now</h2>
    <p class="p-body">When Scott and I put Reline together, we were capturing a moment. But the people in that moment kept going. Here is some of what the Reline artists have been up to in the years since.</p>
